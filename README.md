Description
-----------

By default, Chrome and Kerberos don't play well together. This is a Mac app that wraps a shell 
script which starts Chrome with kerberos flags set.

To Use
------

In ```Contents/Resources/script``` change ```*.knewton.*``` to your own domains which need your
Kerberos support.
